            <P>The world of Faroden is young by the standards of the gods, but old by that of humans. Like all living worlds, Faroden was touched by the gods across all planes. First by the gods of Nature, bringing life to its lands and oceans. Then by the gods of death, bringing challenge and hardship to those who called it home. And like all living worlds, it became a place of growth spurned by conflict.</P>
            <p>The first to truly inhabit the world was that of the dragons. Their populations were small and the territories of an individual dragon was vast and many happenings occurred under their watch. Conflicts were few but bloody. When a god placed the elves to keep their forests the dragons fought to take control and rule them.</p>
            <p>The war was brutal, dragons fell by the dozen and the elves were close to annihilated. while the gods of the elves tried to intervene, the dragons were powerful and aided by their own deities. it wasn't until another race was brought about to assist the elves did the tides turn. The dwarves, short and sturdy the dwarves dug deep mines and forged powerful arms and armor to fight the dragons.</p>
